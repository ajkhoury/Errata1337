# SYSCALL Hook Detection

This is a proof of concept implementation following the write-up on my blog:

[https://revers.engineering/patchguard-detection-of-hypervisor-based-instrospection-p2/](https://revers.engineering/patchguard-detection-of-hypervisor-based-instrospection-p2/)

NOTE: This *is* Patchguard compatible. However this is not VBS/Hyperguard compatible. To force disable VBS, set the following DWORD key to 0:

`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\DeviceGuard:EnableVirtualizationBasedSecurity`

Alternatively you can set the current BCD entry `hypervisorlaunchtype` to `off` - though this also disables Hyper-V.
